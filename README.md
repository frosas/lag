# TODO

- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Try WebSockets (less network and processor overhead?)
- Don't let any space between bars (make it larger)
- Consume as little battery as possible
- Display errored pings distinctly
- Make sounds feel natural even with a 1 second interval (the default in background tabs)
