# TODO

- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Try WebSockets (less network and processor overhead?)
- Chrome crashes after a while when tab is inactive
- Expand chart to window size
- Current latency = time elapsed since the first of the last unresponded pings
- Don't let any space between bars (make it larger)
