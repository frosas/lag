# TODO

- Audio notice when lag is too high
- Make bars appear always from the right
- Make the number of bars fit the width of the svg element
- Bars still don't get removed correctly
- Use color to indicate lag quality (alternative presentation?)
- Use transitions to add/update/remove bars
- Try pinging a blank.js file or through web sockets 
- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Show average pings (like in Unix uptime)
