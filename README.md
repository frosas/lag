# TODO

- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Try WebSockets (less network and processor overhead?)
- Make sure it works in all major browsers
- Make it work [offline](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html) (to start it without a connection)
- When no pings are ponged the current lag (number) is wrong
- Testing
