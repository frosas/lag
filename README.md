# TODO

- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Try WebSockets (less network and processor overhead?)
- Don't let any space between bars (make it grow as needed)
- Consume as little [battery](http://www.w3.org/TR/battery-status/) as possible
- Make sure it works in all major browsers
- Increase require.js loading timeout
- Alert require.js loading errors
- Does volume restores correctly on load?
- Make it work [offline](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html) (to start it without a connection)
