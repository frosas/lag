# TODO

- Make favicon work on Firefox and Safari
- Try WebSockets (less network and processor overhead?)
- Don't let any space between bars (make it larger)
- Consume as little battery as possible
- Make sure it works in major browsers
- Increase require.js loading timeout
- Alert require.js loading errors
- Does volume restores correctly on load?
